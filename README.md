# Flappy Bird AI

A Flappy Bird-style game built with Python and Pygame, featuring an AI model trained on gameplay data. This project enables direct comparison between human player performance and AI-controlled gameplay.

## Features

- Player vs AI gameplay mode
- AI trained on recorded gameplay data
- Pygame-based graphics and physics simulation
- Modular training and inference scripts

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Pygame
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn / Joblib
